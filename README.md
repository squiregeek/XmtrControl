# XmtrControl
Raspberry Pi based time clock to change transmitter power by time of day

Once you have your Raspberry Pi 3 initialized (memory expanded, locale, keyboard, etc), this
step-by-step guide will ensure all dependencies are covered.

1.	sudo apt-get update
2.	sudo apt-get upgrade
3.	sudo apt-get install python3-smbus pytz python3-pifacecad python3-pifacecadrelayplus
4.	git clone https://github.com/abelectronicuk/ABElectronics_Python3_Libraries.git
5.	sudo nano ~/.bashrc

Move to the end of the file and add:

PATH="${PATH}:/home/pi/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries/ADCPi"
export PATH

PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/home/pi/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries/ADCPi"
export PYTHONPATH

6.	Reboot

At this point, the RasPi is ready to run the script. Load it into the home directory and type in the rterminal:

python3 XmtrCtrl.py &

The script should begin and the LCD will first show correct time of day, and then display power in kilowatts and percent of licensed value.

After youâ€™ve installed the control script (e.g., XmtrCtrl.py) in the home directory and have it working, you can set the Pi to run the script at boot time:

sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/myscript.service

Add the following text:

[Unit]
Description=My Script Service
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/pi/myscript.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/myscript.service

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable myscript.service

sudo reboot

To check the service, do this:

sudo systemctl status myscript.service
